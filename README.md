Linked Lists are linear or sequential data structures in which elements are stored at non-contiguous memory locations and are linked to each other using pointers.

Like arrays, linked lists are also linear data structures but in linked lists elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. They can be stored anywhere in the memory but for sequential access, the nodes are linked to each other using pointers.
