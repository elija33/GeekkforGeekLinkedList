# GeekkforGeekLinkedList
Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. We need to reverse the list by changing the links between nodes.

Input: Head of following linked list 
1->2->3->4->NULL 
Output: Linked list should be changed to, 
4->3->2->1->NULL

Input: Head of following linked list 
1->2->3->4->5->NULL 
Output: Linked list should be changed to, 
5->4->3->2->1->NULL

Input: NULL 
Output: NULL

Input: 1->NULL 
Output: 1->NULL 

# Initialize three pointers prev as NULL, curr as head and next as NULL.
# Iterate through the linked list. In loop, do following. 
// Before changing next of current, 
// store next node 
next = curr->next
// Now change next of current 
// This is where actual reversing happens 
curr->next = prev 
// Move prev and curr one step forward 
prev = curr 
curr = next.
